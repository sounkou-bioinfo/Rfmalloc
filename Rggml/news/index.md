# Changelog

## Rggml 0.1.0 (unreleased)

- Fixed webR and Apple Silicon portability. wasm builds use GGML’s
  official SIMD128 quant kernels and omit the incompatible Fortran BLAS
  bridge; dense products continue through the CPU backend. Target-macro
  classification also prevents Apple clang from accepting and then
  ignoring x86 AVX2 flags on arm64. Default package metadata no longer
  makes r-universe provision the optional CUDA toolkit for CPU-only
  builds.

- Updated the generated engine to official GGML v0.16.0. This adds the
  upstream group-64 `Q2_0` ternary block format and lets Rggml consume
  it through the official GGUF and CPU implementations on one
  content-pinned source tree. Upstream does not yet provide a `Q2_0`
  CUDA or Vulkan product.

- Extended the backend-neutral graph C-callables with L2 normalization,
  softplus, MRoPE, gated-delta recurrence, and four-dimensional reshape
  and view operations. Rllm composes these reusable operators for
  Qwen3.5 without linking GGML or adding a native model-family class.

- Corrected CUDA launch geometry for recurrent models. SSM convolution
  selects a thread width that divides the channel count, while
  gated-delta kernels support power-of-two state widths from 1 through
  128 without partial-warp out-of-bounds access. The Qwen3.5 whole-batch
  and incremental graph tests run these paths on the RTX rig.

- Removed the unused C-callable API counter and its accumulated version
  strata. The installed header is the one current monorepo contract. The
  official GGUF writer service also accepts string-array metadata, which
  makes hermetic tokenizer-bearing model fixtures possible without
  another writer.

- Corrected the aarch64 fallback map so the generic Q1 dot product keeps
  its `_generic` name while GGML’s ARM translation unit owns the
  canonical NEON symbol. Rggml now links cleanly on both Apple Silicon
  and Linux aarch64.

- Added an opt-in `--with-cuda` build from the content-pinned official
  GGML CUDA sources.
  [`rggml_cuda_info()`](https://sounkou-bioinfo.github.io/Rfmalloc/Rggml/reference/rggml_cuda_info.md)
  probes without making CUDA a hard dependency, and dense F32 plus Q4_K
  products use the same backend-owned buffer allocation, upload, compute
  and download path as Vulkan. The build accepts `CUDA_HOME` and
  `RGGML_CUDA_ARCH`; ordinary CPU builds never invoke `nvcc`. Extended
  Blackwell targets such as `sm_120a` emit matching PTX and SASS.
  Optional CUDA graph capture is gated by `RGGML_CUDA_GRAPHS=1` and is
  disabled by default after a slower full-generation measurement on the
  rig.

- Added GGML’s official `gguf.cpp` to the generated vendor recipe and
  exposed its indexed reader and writer as opaque C-callable services.
  Rgguf now owns only its R surface and read-only tensor mapping; the
  partial second parser and duplicate quantized decoders are gone.

- Added `rggml_mul_mat(A, B, backend)`, a public GEMM
  (`crossprod(A, B)`) on the `"cpu"`, `"blas"`, or `"vulkan"` backend
  via GGML’s device-buffer residency path - the supported entry point
  for a dense single-precision matrix multiply on the GPU, promoted from
  the internal test routine.

- Added
  [`rggml_cpu_info()`](https://sounkou-bioinfo.github.io/Rfmalloc/Rggml/reference/rggml_cpu_info.md),
  reporting what `configure` actually compiled: `arch_kernels` (`"arm"`
  for GGML’s native NEON kernels, `"wasm"` for its SIMD128 kernels,
  `"generic"` for the portable ones), `simd_dispatch`, `blas`, `sgemm`,
  `vulkan`, and `cuda`. Every branch `configure` can take is numerically
  correct, so no numerical test can tell them apart: a build that
  silently fell back from the NEON kernels, or from `sgemm_` to the
  `dgemm_` promotion, passes the whole suite. `test_cpu_info.R` now
  asserts on this, including the invariant that `arch_kernels == "arm"`
  and `simd_dispatch` are mutually exclusive (both define the canonical
  `ggml_vec_dot_q4_K_q8_K`, and the linker would silently pick one), and
  that real aarch64 CI runners land on `"arm"`.

- **On aarch64, GGML’s own hand-tuned NEON kernels are compiled in**
  instead of the portable scalar reference: 23 `vec_dot`s covering every
  quantized type, not just the one `q4_K` variant the SIMD dispatcher
  stages. NEON is a mandatory baseline of the architecture, so
  `ggml-cpu/arch/arm/quants.c` needs no ISA flag and cannot produce a
  binary that will not run on the machine that built it; `configure`
  therefore drops `-DGGML_CPU_GENERIC` and skips the dispatcher there
  (`arch/arm` defines the canonical symbols it would duplicate). x86
  keeps the dispatcher on purpose: `arch/x86`’s kernels are selected by
  compile-time `#if defined(__AVX2__)`, so a `-mavx2` build of them
  would *require* AVX2 at runtime - which is why GGML upstream needs
  `GGML_CPU_ALL_VARIANTS` plus `dlopen` and we do not.

- **Fixed a BLAS link failure on Windows** that was really a portability
  bug. R guarantees only the **double-precision** BLAS: `<R_ext/BLAS.h>`
  declares no single-precision routine and `Rblas.dll` exports no
  `sgemm_`. Most Linux reference BLAS builds happen to export it, which
  is why the `cblas_sgemm` shim linked here but not there. `configure`
  now link-probes `sgemm_` against R’s own `BLAS_LIBS`/`FLIBS`; where it
  is missing, the shim promotes its operands to double, calls `dgemm_`
  (still an optimized BLAS), and demotes the result - correct to float
  precision, with a naive triple loop only if the temporaries cannot be
  allocated. Set `RGGML_NO_SGEMM=1` to force the promoted path anywhere.

- **Rggml now builds on Windows** (Rtools/MinGW); `OS_type: unix` is
  gone. R runs `configure.win`, which re-execs the single `configure`
  with `RGGML_WINDOWS=1` rather than duplicating the SIMD probe, the
  Vulkan shader pipeline and the `libggml.a` build. The Windows branch
  writes `src/Makevars.win` without `-ldl` (Windows has no libdl) and
  locates the Vulkan SDK under its Windows layout
  (`$VULKAN_SDK/Bin/glslc.exe`, `-lvulkan-1`). A `windows-latest` CI job
  verifies it. The vendored GGML was already Windows-hardened: the
  by-pointer `ggml_backend_buffer_i` and
  never-destroyed-teardown-singleton patches exist precisely because
  passing that POD by value, and running those destructors at exit,
  crashed on Windows/MinGW.

- Added the **Vulkan GPU backend**, vendored from the same pinned
  official GGML source as the CPU core through `tools/vendor-ggml`. It
  is **opt-in at build time**, never auto-detected:

      install.packages("Rggml", configure.args = "--with-vulkan")
      R CMD INSTALL --configure-args=--with-vulkan .

  Auto-detection would be hostile: GGML embeds 156 compiled SPIR-V
  shaders as C++ translation units, and the largest (`mul_mm`, a 141 MB
  array literal) needs ~5 GB of RAM to compile - independent of `-O`
  level, since the cost is parsing the literal. `configure` probes
  `glslc`’s optional shader features (coopmat, coopmat2, integer_dot,
  bfloat16), builds the shader generator, and compiles the shader set
  those features imply; it errors out clearly if `--with-vulkan` is
  given without `glslc`/Vulkan headers. Without the flag, nothing about
  the build changes. New C-callables: `Rggml_backend_vulkan_init`,
  `Rggml_backend_vulkan_device_count`, and
  `Rggml_backend_vulkan_device_description`; they report zero devices
  instead of failing when the backend was not built, so callers can
  probe and fall back. R-level:
  [`rggml_vulkan_info()`](https://sounkou-bioinfo.github.io/Rfmalloc/Rggml/reference/rggml_vulkan_info.md),
  [`rggml_has_vulkan()`](https://sounkou-bioinfo.github.io/Rfmalloc/Rggml/reference/rggml_vulkan_info.md).

- Added the **device-buffer residency C-callables**:
  `Rggml_backend_alloc_ctx_tensors`, `Rggml_backend_buffer_free`,
  `Rggml_backend_tensor_set`, `Rggml_backend_tensor_get`. The CPU and
  BLAS backends compute on host memory, so pointing a tensor at an R
  buffer works; a GPU backend’s tensors must live in device memory.
  These wrap GGML’s backend-agnostic path - allocate a no_alloc
  context’s tensors into one backend buffer, upload, compute, download -
  which is identical for CPU, BLAS Vulkan and CUDA, and is what
  `test_vulkan.R` uses to assert the GPU backend computes the same
  product as the CPU one.

- Added **view and copy C-callables**: `Rggml_view_1d`/ `_2d`/`_3d`
  (byte offsets/strides, as in ggml) and `Rggml_cpy` - the building
  blocks of a KV cache: cpy nodes write new keys/values into views of a
  persistent cache tensor, expanded into the graph ahead of the
  attention nodes that read other views of the same cache (see Rllm’s
  incremental decoding).

- Added the transformer **graph-op C-callables**: the ops a forward pass
  composes - `Rggml_get_rows`, `Rggml_rms_norm`, `Rggml_mul`,
  `Rggml_add`, `Rggml_silu`, `Rggml_scale`, `Rggml_soft_max`,
  `Rggml_diag_mask_inf`, `Rggml_rope` (wrapping `ggml_rope_ext` with
  YaRN off), and the shape ops `Rggml_reshape_2d`/`_3d`,
  `Rggml_permute`, `Rggml_cont`, `Rggml_transpose`. Downstream packages
  can now assemble and compute full transformer graphs (see Rllm’s llama
  forward pass) without linking GGML.

- Added quantization C-callables: `Rggml_quantize` wraps
  `ggml_quantize_chunk()` so downstream packages can encode f32 rows
  into any GGUF block format (the output is byte-compatible with GGUF
  tensor payloads), and `Rggml_dequantize` wraps GGML’s type-traits
  `to_float` - the authoritative reference dequantizer, used by the
  Rfmalloc ecosystem to cross-validate its codec decoders (this
  cross-validation caught and pinned a Q4_K decode bug in Rgguf’s
  vendored gguflib; see that package’s NEWS).

- Verified the full quantized-weight compute path over an external
  payload: a `Q4_K` tensor pointed zero-copy at a heap buffer standing
  in for an mmap’d GGUF payload, multiplied by dense F32 activations via
  `ggml_mul_mat()` on the CPU backend, routes each weight row through
  the runtime-SIMD-dispatched `vec_dot` (activations quantized to `Q8_K`
  on the fly, as at llama.cpp inference) and tracks the true product to
  q4_K accuracy (`test_mul_mat_q4k.R`).

- Initial release. Rggml is a carrier package: it vendors a CPU-only,
  architecture-generic build of the ‘GGML’ tensor library as a static
  library (`inst/ggml/libggml.a`), installs its headers, and exposes
  GGML’s tensor-context/matrix-multiply compute path through
  `R_RegisterCCallable` C-callable entry points, declared for downstream
  use in `inst/include/Rggml.h`.

- Registered C-callables: context lifecycle (`Rggml_context_create`,
  `Rggml_context_free`, plus `Rggml_used_mem`/`Rggml_tensor_overhead`/
  `Rggml_graph_overhead` for sizing), tensor creation with an optional
  zero-copy external data pointer (`Rggml_new_tensor`,
  `Rggml_tensor_data`, `Rggml_tensor_set_data`, `Rggml_tensor_ne`,
  `Rggml_tensor_nb`), the CPU backend (`Rggml_backend_cpu_init`,
  `Rggml_backend_free`, `Rggml_backend_graph_compute`), graph building
  (`Rggml_new_graph`, `Rggml_build_forward_expand`), matrix multiply
  (`Rggml_mul_mat`, and the canned single-op `Rggml_compute_mul_mat`
  that also copies the F32 result into a caller-provided
  `float*`/`double*` buffer), and type/size introspection
  (`Rggml_type_size`, `Rggml_row_size`, `Rggml_blck_size`,
  `Rggml_nbytes`, `Rggml_nelements`, `Rggml_type_name`).

- Added runtime SIMD dispatch for `q4_K x q8_K`. On x86, `configure`
  compiles GGML’s official `arch/x86/quants.c` translation unit under
  private names and a CPUID dispatcher selects its Q4_K dot only when
  the complete upstream AVX2 feature set is present. Aarch64 and wasm
  compile GGML’s complete official architecture sources directly. ISA
  flags stay out of R’s recorded package flags, and the portable GGML
  implementation remains the fallback.

- Enabled GGML’s **BLAS backend** (`Rggml_backend_blas_init`,
  `Rggml_backend_blas_set_n_threads`): dense F32 `mul_mat` offloads to
  whatever BLAS the R build links against, since BLAS is universal in R.
  GGML’s backend calls the C `cblas_sgemm`, which R does not provide, so
  Rggml bridges it with a small portable shim (`inst/ggml/cblas.h` +
  `rggml_cblas.c`) forwarding to the Fortran BLAS via `F77_NAME()`,
  linking `$(BLAS_LIBS) $(FLIBS)`. The BLAS backend is a drop-in
  `backend` for the existing
  `Rggml_compute_mul_mat`/`Rggml_backend_graph_compute` path.

- Added
  [`ggml_version()`](https://sounkou-bioinfo.github.io/Rfmalloc/Rggml/reference/ggml_version.md),
  returning the vendored GGML library’s own runtime version string.

- Verified and documented the `ggml_mul_mat()` convention: loading two R
  matrices directly into GGML tensors with `ne = dim(matrix)` (the raw
  column-major bytes, no copy or transpose), `ggml_mul_mat(ctx, A, B)`
  produces a result tensor of dim `(ncol(A), ncol(B))` equal to
  `crossprod(A, B)` (`t(A) %*% B`). Covered by the tinytest suite with
  both hand-checkable small cases and larger random matrices, through
  both the ggml-managed and the zero-copy (externally-owned buffer)
  tensor creation paths, exercised via the registered C-callables (not
  the internal implementation functions directly).

- CPU kernels are architecture-generic (no `-march` SIMD flags, no
  OpenMP, no hand-written x86 SIMD kernel files) for CRAN-facing build
  portability, plus the BLAS backend above for dense products. No
  Vulkan/CUDA/Metal GPU backends. Runtime-SIMD-dispatched quantized
  kernels (`GGML_CPU_ALL_VARIANTS`) and a Vulkan backend are planned;
  see README.md.
