# RfmallocStatgen 0.1.0 (unreleased)

- The pinned PCAone logger now initializes its screen state deterministically
  and sends optional output through R's console instead of `std::cout` or
  `std::cerr`. The adaptation is part of the byte-checked vendoring recipe.

- `RfmallocStatgen` is the statistical-genetics layer over Rfmalloc genotype,
  haplotype, and LD stores. Its current surface covers streamed regression and
  PCA, banded LD, LDpred2, and matrix-form colocalisation; `ROADMAP.md` tracks
  the remaining research directions.
- `statgen_gwas_lin()`: univariate linear-regression GWAS over a `bed` or
  `dosage` fmalloc genotype tensor, the fused whole-genome form (residualize
  once on the covariate design, then reduce per variant), not a loop of
  per-variant `lm()` calls. Missing genotype calls are mean-imputed per
  variant. `inst/tinytest/test_gwas_lin.R` checks `beta`/`se`/`t`/`p` for
  every variant against `lm(y ~ covar + g_j)` to floating-point tolerance,
  and cross-checks against `bigstatsr::big_univLinReg()` when `bigstatsr` is
  installed.
- `statgen_pca()`: fast principal-component analysis by randomized SVD. The
  RSVD workhorse is pinned from GPL-3 'PCAone', with deterministic dependency
  trimming and R-console adaptation
  (`src/pcaone/`, `RsvdOpData::computeUSV`), not reimplemented, behind the
  pinned drift-guard recipe `tools/vendor-pcaone/vendorpcaone.R` (CI job
  `vendored-pcaone-matches-recipe`). This makes the package compiled for the
  first time (`LinkingTo: RcppEigen`, C++17). Stage 1 drives the vendored
  core over an in-memory matrix; `inst/tinytest/test_pca.R` matches
  `base::svd()`, `stats::prcomp()`, and `pcaone::pcaone()` to ~1e-6 (in
  practice machine precision on a decaying spectrum).
- `statgen_pca()` now also takes a 2-D `bed`/`dosage` fmalloc genotype tensor
  and decomposes it **out of core**: the tensor is streamed one variant-column
  block at a time through Rfmalloc's fused-standardize decode (the new
  `Rfmalloc_tensor_decode` C-callable, API v7) and the dense samples x variants
  matrix is never materialized. To get a standardized PCA, standardize the
  tensor first (`fmalloc_bed_standardize()` / `fmalloc_dosage_standardize()`) -
  standardization rides the decode. `inst/tinytest/test_pca_ooc.R` checks that
  the out-of-core result equals the in-core path on the same standardized
  tensor to floating point, independent of the streaming block size, for both
  `bed` and `dosage`.
- `statgen_snp_cor()`: windowed LD (correlation) matrix from a `bed`/`dosage`
  fmalloc genotype tensor, packed into a banded `Rfmalloc::fmalloc_ld` store.
  The genotype tensor is streamed one variant column at a time through
  `Rfmalloc_tensor_decode` (the dense samples x variants matrix is never
  materialized, only a sliding window of unit columns bounded by the window
  width); each column is mean-imputed, centred and unit-L2-normalized, and the
  correlation of two nearby variants is the dot product of their unit columns -
  the fused form `bigsnpr::snp_cor()` uses. The window is `size` variants each
  side by index, or `size` kb of physical distance when `infos_pos` is given
  (bigsnpr's convention). `inst/tinytest/test_snp_cor.R` checks the banded
  result equals `stats::cor()` on the decoded matrix within the int8/int16
  quantization tolerance (max |diff| ~3.9e-3 at int8), the position-based
  window and `thr_r2` behaviour, and - guarded by `requireNamespace` - matches
  `bigsnpr::snp_cor()` on the same complete-data matrix.
- `statgen_ldpred2_inf()`, `statgen_ldpred2()` and `statgen_ldpred2_auto()`:
  LDpred2 (Prive, Arbel & Vilhjalmsson 2020), reimplemented clean-room over the
  banded `Rfmalloc::fmalloc_ld` LD store. All three read the LD matrix one
  column's neighbour run at a time (the `fmalloc_ld` C-callables), never the
  genotypes or a dense p x p. `statgen_ldpred2_inf()` is the deterministic
  infinitesimal model: it solves the ridge-like system `(C + m/(h2 N) I) b =
  beta_hat` by conjugate gradient over the band. `statgen_ldpred2()` is the
  LDpred2-grid Gibbs sampler (spike-and-slab prior, causal effects
  `~ N(0, h2/(m p))`), returning the Rao-Blackwellized posterior mean.
  `statgen_ldpred2_auto()` estimates `p` and `h2` from the data each iteration
  (the `alpha = -1`, `sigma2 = h2/(m p)` variant). `inst/tinytest/test_ldpred2.R`
  matches `snp_ldpred2_inf` to solver tolerance (max |diff| ~4e-12 against both
  a dense `solve()` and, guarded by `requireNamespace`, `bigsnpr`), and matches
  `snp_ldpred2_grid` / `snp_ldpred2_auto(use_MLE = FALSE)` within Monte-Carlo
  error (posterior-mean correlation > 0.99, and recovers the simulated p / h2),
  plus deterministic seeded self-consistency checks that run without bigsnpr.
- `statgen_coloc_bf()`: all-pairs Bayesian colocalisation of two traits'
  signals, coloc's `coloc.bf_bf` recast as a single matrix multiply. Stacking
  each trait's per-SNP log approximate Bayes factors as a matrix of signals,
  the shared-causal (H4) coupling for every signal pair is one stabilized
  log-sum-exp GEMM (`c = outer(m1,m2,"+") + log(E1 %*% t(E2))`); the coloc
  posteriors PP0..PP4 follow elementwise. The hot kernel therefore rides any
  backend 'Rggml' offers via `backend = "cpu"` / `"blas"` / `"vulkan"` -
  including a Vulkan GPU - and larger-than-memory signal sets via the
  out-of-core panel-GEMM; this is the same idea as gpu-coloc (Torch) without
  its CUDA/Metal-only lock-in. `trim = TRUE` returns the per-pair posterior
  overlap and flags low-overlap H4 (the analogue of `trim_by_posterior`).
  `inst/tinytest/test_coloc_bf.R` proves the matrix form is identical to the
  consecutive per-pair form to machine precision, that the single-precision
  backend agrees with the double-precision CPU path, and that it recovers
  colocalisation vs distinct causals.
